# Risk Assessment - Example

This document is an example of a risk assessment conducted for a **hypothetical** security company, including an asset invetory and risk mitigation strategy.

Risk is determined through a custom algorithm utilizing the [FIPS 199](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/fips/nist.fips.199.pdf).

The risk mitigation strategies are designed around the NIST 800 series of special publications, including the [NIST 800-37](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-37r2.pdf), the [NIST 800-39](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-39.pdf), the [NIST 800-53](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf), and the [NIST 800-88](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-88r1.pdf).

**This document was created as part of a larger exercise to build a comprehensive, actionable cybersecurity policy for a hypothetical organization.**
